## **Intel OneAPI**

**oneAPI** is an open, standards-based programming model that's designed to help developers create applications that target a variety of architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. It's intended to eliminate the need for developers to maintain separate code bases for each architecture.

## **Utilizing Intel OneAPI PyTorch Acceleration**

To utilize Intel's acceleration, we're using the library `intel_extension_for_pytorch`:

```python
import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex
optimized_tag_generator = ipex.optimize(tag_generator, dtype=torch.bfloat16)
